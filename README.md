# About App

All users can create, edit users. Manager can delete users who are their underlings.

Only a manager can assign, edit, delete a task to his underlings.

User can only edit the timestamps(start/end) of a task assigned to him under View.

Editing the timestamps are available once the timer is stopped.

A user can update his own task if he is his own manager.

Tasks not assigned to any user can be assigned by a manager only to his underlings.
